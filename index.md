### CPSC 120

* Lab 4 Part 2:

    This lab was fun because it was where I really began to realize how there are infinite possibilities of things that you can do with coding. The first couple of labs were pretty simple and seemed like they were to get you familiar with everything. However this one made me see how you can do so many things that you are able to do and it made me become more interested.

* Lab 6 Part 2 :

    This was my favorite lab overall because of the fact that we created a program that lets you play blackjack. Blackjack has been a game that I learned how to play before but I would have never thought that I would create a program that would allow you to play it. This was the overall most fun because it was something that I had known about before and was already interested in. 

* Lab  9 Part 1 :

    This was the lab where I really was tested and realized that coding is not a walk in the park. This one had me stuck for a while until I had to get help, every time I was always close but never had the right answer. This feeling makes you frustrated because it keeps on making me think “how could I not remember that” but with this it helps me realize all the different ways that you are able to do things and that if one way doesn't work then there is always another way that you are able to do it.
